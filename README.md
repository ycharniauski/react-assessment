### How to Run It

You can run the application from command line or using an IDE.

#### Running from Command Line

1. Make sure you are inside the `react-assessment` folder.
2. First you will need to install the npm dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Run tests:
    ```
    npm test
    ```
4. Run using npm:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
5. Your client will be available on port 8082. Go to **http://127.0.0.1:8082/** to test it.

6. You can stop the client using `Ctrl + C`. If you need to use the console for something else, you should open a new terminal tab or window.
